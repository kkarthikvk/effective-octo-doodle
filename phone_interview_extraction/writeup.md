## Possibilities

- Sample inputs
    - 15-30 minute phone interview followed by 60 minute in person interview
    - 30 minute in person for local and 30 minute phone for non-local
    - 30 minute phone interview follow by 90 minute in person for local candidates
    - 30 minute phone interview follow by Skype interview then 90 minute in person for non-local candidates
    - 30 minute Phone Screen (with Delivery Manager, or PM)
    - 1st round: 30 minute phone screen


## Approach

- We have two sets of words that we look for. If a word from both the sets exist in a single sentence we can be sure that it includes a phone interview.  
- We **do not** check for negations like "No phone interview", "n/a" etc. Information about multiple interviews are given in the same line. The negation can apply to any of them.  
- If there's no interview it's very unlikely of them to mention those words in the first place.
